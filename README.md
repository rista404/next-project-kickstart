# "Next" project kickstart 🤘🏻 🚀

*Still polishing some stuff.*

Includes **es2015**, **cssnext** and a nice build system.

Easily configurable, uses **rollup** and **postcss**.


### Instructions

Just place `index.html` and all your stuff inside `/dist` directory.

Install all dependencies with `npm install`

Start in development mode with `npm start`

Build for production with `npm run build`

### Hot code reloading

I haven't added any hot-code reload functionality, but I recommend installing **browser-sync** and running `browser-sync start -s dist --files dist/**/*` from the project root.
